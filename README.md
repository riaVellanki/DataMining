#About Me
Hi! I'm Ria, a junior at UNC Charlotte studying computer science with a concentration in Software Engineering and a minor in Bioinformatics and Mathematics. Although I am focusing my studies on Software Engineering, I have found a love for Data Science in the past few months and am eager to learn more! I am currently taking Into to Data Mining, a course where I will learn to preprocess, analyze, visualize, and find insights from data.
